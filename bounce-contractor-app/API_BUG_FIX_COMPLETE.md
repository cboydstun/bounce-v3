# API Bug Fix - Complete

## Problem Summary

The mobile app was experiencing API errors when trying to claim tasks:

```
Processed API Error: {
    "code": "UNKNOWN_ERROR",
    "message": "Request failed with status code 400",
    "statusCode": 500
}

Failed to claim task: {
    "code": "UNKNOWN_ERROR",
    "message": "Request failed with status code 400",
    "statusCode": 500
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **missing `/api` prefix** in the API endpoint URLs throughout the mobile app. The mobile app was calling endpoints like `/tasks/{id}/claim` while the server expected `/api/tasks/{id}/claim`.

### Key Issues Identified:

1. **Endpoint URL Mismatch**: Mobile app endpoints were missing the `/api` prefix
2. **Error Status Code Confusion**: API client was incorrectly setting statusCode to 500 even for 400/404 errors
3. **Poor Error Message Handling**: Error responses for non-existent endpoints weren't being handled properly

## Files Fixed

### 1. Task Actions Hook (`bounce-contractor-app/src/hooks/tasks/useTaskActions.ts`)

**Fixed Endpoints:**

- `/tasks/{id}/claim` → `/api/tasks/{id}/claim`
- `/tasks/{id}/status` → `/api/tasks/{id}/status`
- `/tasks/{id}/complete` → `/api/tasks/{id}/complete`
- `/tasks/{id}/cancel` → `/api/tasks/{id}/cancel`
- `/tasks/{id}/photos` → `/api/tasks/{id}/photos`
- `/tasks/{id}/issues` → `/api/tasks/{id}/issues`
- `/tasks/{id}/directions` → `/api/tasks/{id}/directions`

**Offline Queue Endpoints Also Fixed:**

- Updated offline queue endpoints to include `/api` prefix for proper sync

### 2. Task Queries Hook (`bounce-contractor-app/src/hooks/tasks/useTasks.ts`)

**Fixed Endpoints:**

- `/tasks/available` → `/api/tasks/available`
- `/tasks/my-tasks` → `/api/tasks/my-tasks`
- `/tasks/{id}` → `/api/tasks/{id}`
- `/tasks/stats` → `/api/tasks/stats`

### 3. API Client Error Handling (`bounce-contractor-app/src/services/api/apiClient.ts`)

**Improvements Made:**

- **Preserved Original Status Codes**: Fixed the issue where 400/404 errors were being converted to 500
- **Better Error Message Handling**: Improved handling of different server response formats
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added more comprehensive error logging for troubleshooting

## Server-Side Verification

The API server routes were confirmed to be correctly configured:

**Route Structure (`api-server/src/routes/tasks.ts`):**

- `GET /api/tasks/available` ✅
- `GET /api/tasks/my-tasks` ✅
- `GET /api/tasks/:id` ✅
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/claim` ✅
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id/status` ✅
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/complete` ✅

**Controller Implementation (`api-server/src/controllers/taskController.ts`):**

- All endpoints properly implemented with validation
- Proper error responses with correct status codes
- Authentication and authorization checks in place

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Task Claiming Flow

```bash
# Test the complete task claiming flow
1. Login to the mobile app
2. Navigate to available tasks
3. Attempt to claim a task
4. Verify successful claim without API errors
```

### 2. API Connectivity Test

```bash
# Use the built-in connectivity test
apiClient.testConnectivity()
```

### 3. Error Handling Verification

```bash
# Test with invalid task ID to verify proper error handling
# Should now return 404 with statusCode: 404 instead of 500
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### ✅ Successful Task Claiming

- Task claiming should work without "Request failed with status code 400" errors
- Proper success responses with task data

### ✅ Accurate Error Codes

- 400 errors will have `statusCode: 400` (not 500)
- 404 errors will have `statusCode: 404` (not 500)
- Network errors will have `statusCode: 0`

### ✅ Better Error Messages

- More descriptive error messages based on actual server responses
- Proper handling of HTML error pages and empty responses

### ✅ Consistent API Communication

- All task-related API calls now use the correct `/api` prefix
- Offline queue actions will sync properly when connectivity is restored

## Deployment Notes

### Mobile App

- No additional configuration required
- Changes are in TypeScript/JavaScript code only
- Compatible with existing API server

### API Server

- No changes required on server side
- Existing routes and controllers remain unchanged
- All authentication and validation logic preserved

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor for:

1. **Reduced API Error Rates**: Should see significant reduction in 400/500 errors
2. **Successful Task Claims**: Task claiming functionality should work reliably
3. **Proper Error Reporting**: Error logs should show accurate status codes
4. **Offline Sync Success**: Queued actions should sync properly when online

## Summary

This fix resolves the core API communication issue between the mobile app and server by:

1. ✅ **Correcting endpoint URLs** to include the required `/api` prefix
2. ✅ **Preserving HTTP status codes** for accurate error reporting
3. ✅ **Improving error message handling** for better debugging
4. ✅ **Maintaining offline functionality** with corrected sync endpoints

The mobile app should now successfully communicate with the API server for all task-related operations.

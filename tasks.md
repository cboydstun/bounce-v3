# Task Management System Implementation

## Overview

A comprehensive task management system for bounce house rental operations, integrated into the existing order management workflow. This system allows admins to create, track, and manage delivery, setup, pickup, and maintenance tasks for each order.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE + ENHANCED

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation ✅

- **Task Model** (`src/models/Task.ts`)

  - Mongoose schema with comprehensive validation
  - Status transition workflow enforcement
  - Date/time validation with buffer for immediate scheduling
  - Compound indexes for optimized queries
  - Static methods for common operations

- **API Routes**

  - `GET /api/v1/orders/[id]/tasks` - Fetch all tasks for an order
  - `POST /api/v1/orders/[id]/tasks` - Create new task for an order
  - `GET /api/v1/tasks/[id]` - Get individual task details
  - `PUT /api/v1/tasks/[id]` - Update existing task
  - `DELETE /api/v1/tasks/[id]` - Delete task (only if status="Pending")

- **Type Definitions** (`src/types/task.ts`)
  - Complete TypeScript interfaces for type safety
  - Task, TaskFormData, and Mongoose document interfaces
  - Static method definitions for the model

### Phase 2: Frontend Components ✅

- **TaskSection** (`src/components/tasks/TaskSection.tsx`)

  - Main task management interface
  - Handles all CRUD operations
  - Error handling and loading states
  - Optimistic UI updates
  - Task sorting by date and priority

- **TaskForm** (`src/components/tasks/TaskForm.tsx`)

  - Modal form for creating/editing tasks
  - Comprehensive client-side validation
  - Dynamic form fields (status only shown when editing)
  - Date/time picker with smart defaults

- **TaskCard** (`src/components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx`)

  - Individual task display component
  - Color-coded priority and status badges
  - Type-specific icons
  - Edit/Delete action buttons
  - Conditional delete (only for "Pending" tasks)

- **StatusBadge** (`src/components/ui/StatusBadge.tsx`)
  - Reusable component for status and priority display
  - Color-coded for quick visual identification

### Phase 3: Integration ✅

- **Order Detail Page** (`src/app/admin/orders/[id]/page.tsx`)

  - Replaced simple task list with full TaskSection component
  - Seamless integration with existing order workflow
  - Maintains all existing functionality

- **Model Registration** (`src/models/index.ts`)
  - Added Task model to central model registry
  - Ensures proper model initialization

### Phase 4: Contractor Assignment System ✅

- **Contractor Model** (`src/models/Contractor.ts`)

  - Comprehensive contractor management with skills tracking
  - Active/inactive status management
  - Contact information storage (email, phone)
  - Flexible skills array for specialization tracking
  - Soft delete functionality (deactivation)

- **Contractor APIs** (`src/app/api/v1/contractors/`)

  - `GET /api/v1/contractors` - List all contractors (with filtering)
  - `POST /api/v1/contractors` - Create new contractor
  - `GET /api/v1/contractors/[id]` - Get individual contractor
  - `PUT /api/v1/contractors/[id]` - Update contractor details
  - `DELETE /api/v1/contractors/[id]` - Deactivate contractor

- **Enhanced Task Assignment**

  - Multi-contractor assignment capability
  - Visual contractor selection interface
  - Skills-based contractor recommendations
  - Real-time contractor loading and display
  - Backward compatibility with legacy assignments

- **Contractor Management Interface** (`src/app/admin/contractors/page.tsx`)

  - Full CRUD contractor management
  - Skills management with add/remove functionality
  - Active/inactive status toggle
  - Responsive grid layout with contractor cards
  - Modal-based forms for create/edit operations

- **Navigation Integration** (`src/components/ui/Sidebar.tsx`)
  - Added "Contractors" link to admin navigation
  - Positioned logically in the admin workflow

## Features Implemented

### Task Types

- **Delivery** 🚚 - Equipment delivery to customer location
- **Setup** 🔧 - On-site equipment setup and installation
- **Pickup** 📦 - Equipment retrieval after event
- **Maintenance** ⚙️ - Equipment cleaning, repair, or inspection

### Priority Levels

- **High** (Red badge) - Urgent tasks requiring immediate attention
- **Medium** (Yellow badge) - Standard priority tasks
- **Low** (Green badge) - Non-urgent tasks

### Status Workflow

```
Pending → Assigned → In Progress → Completed
    ↓         ↓           ↓
Cancelled ← Cancelled ← Cancelled
    ↓
Pending (reactivation)
```

### Key Business Rules

1. **Date Validation**: Tasks cannot be scheduled in the past (5-minute buffer)
2. **Status Transitions**: Enforced workflow prevents invalid status changes
3. **Delete Protection**: Only "Pending" tasks can be deleted
4. **Completed Tasks**: Cannot be modified once marked complete
5. **Contractor Assignment**: Optional field for task delegation

### User Interface Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded badges for quick status identification
- **Smart Sorting**: Tasks sorted by scheduled date, then priority
- **Empty States**: Helpful messaging when no tasks exist
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and validation
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevents accidental deletions

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

```typescript
interface Task {
  _id: string;
  orderId: string; // Reference to Order
  type: "Delivery" | "Setup" | "Pickup" | "Maintenance";
  description: string; // Task details (max 1000 chars)
  scheduledDateTime: Date; // When task is scheduled
  priority: "High" | "Medium" | "Low";
  status: "Pending" | "Assigned" | "In Progress" | "Completed" | "Cancelled";
  assignedContractors: string[]; // Array of contractor IDs
  assignedTo?: string; // Legacy field for backward compatibility
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface Contractor {
  _id: string;
  name: string; // Contractor/company name
  email?: string; // Contact email
  phone?: string; // Contact phone
  skills?: string[]; // Array of skills/specialties
  isActive: boolean; // Whether contractor is active
  notes?: string; // Admin notes about contractor
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### API Endpoints

- **Authentication**: All endpoints protected with NextAuth middleware
- **Validation**: Comprehensive server-side validation
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Performance**: Optimized queries with compound indexes

### Frontend Architecture

- **Component Hierarchy**: TaskSection → TaskCard/TaskForm → StatusBadge
- **State Management**: Local React state with optimistic updates
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling throughout the UI
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage

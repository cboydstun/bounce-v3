# Task Payment Amount Management Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Task Payment Amount Management feature for the Bounce House Rental system.

## Overview

The Task Payment Amount Management feature allows administrators to create, read, update, and delete payment amounts for tasks, enabling proper contractor compensation tracking and financial obligation management.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Data Model Updates

#### Task Types (`src/types/task.ts`)

- Added `paymentAmount?: number` field to the main Task interface
- Added payment amount to TaskFormData interface
- Created new `TaskPaymentHistory` interface for tracking payment changes
- Added `ITaskPaymentHistoryDocument` and `ITaskPaymentHistoryModel` interfaces
- Added new static methods for payment-related queries:
  - `findByPaymentRange(minAmount, maxAmount)`
  - `getPaymentStats(filters)`

#### Task Model (`src/models/Task.ts`)

- Added `paymentAmount` field to Mongoose schema with validation:
  - Minimum value: 0 (positive numbers only)
  - Maximum value: $999,999.99
  - Validates monetary values with up to 2 decimal places
- Added database indexes for payment queries:
  - `paymentAmount: 1`
  - `paymentAmount: 1, status: 1`
- Implemented static methods:
  - `findByPaymentRange()` - Find tasks within payment amount range
  - `getPaymentStats()` - Generate payment statistics with aggregation

#### TaskPaymentHistory Model (`src/models/TaskPaymentHistory.ts`)

- New model for tracking all payment amount changes
- Fields:
  - `taskId` - Reference to the task
  - `orderId` - Reference to the order
  - `previousAmount` - Previous payment amount
  - `newAmount` - New payment amount
  - `changedBy` - Admin user ID who made the change
  - `changedByName` - Admin user name for display
  - `reason` - Optional reason for the change
  - `createdAt` - Timestamp of the change
- Static methods:
  - `createPaymentChange()` - Create new payment history entry
  - `findByTaskId()` - Get payment history for a task
  - `findByOrderId()` - Get payment history for an order

### 2. API Enhancements

#### Updated Task API (`src/app/api/v1/tasks/[id]/route.ts`)

- Enhanced PUT endpoint to handle payment amount changes
- Added payment amount validation
- Implemented payment change logging
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing task updates

#### New Payment-Specific API (`src/app/api/v1/tasks/[id]/payment/route.ts`)

- **PUT** - Update payment amount for a specific task
  - Validates payment amount (positive, max $999,999.99, 2 decimal places)
  - Logs payment changes to history
  - Returns updated task and success message
- **DELETE** - Clear payment amount for a task
  - Requires confirmation
  - Logs payment clearing to history
  - Preserves historical data
- **GET** - Retrieve payment history for a task
  - Returns current payment amount and complete payment history

#### Payment Reports API (`src/app/api/v1/tasks/payment-reports/route.ts`)

- **GET** endpoint with multiple report types:
  - `type=summary` - Payment statistics and status breakdown
  - `type=detailed` - Detailed task list with payment information
  - `type=range` - Payment amount range analysis
- Supports filtering by:

  - Reason tracking for payment changes
  - Input validation (positive numbers, 2 decimal places, max $999,999.99)

- **Filtering & Search**

  - Filter by task status
  - Filter by payment amount range (min/max)
  - Filter by date range
  - Clear all filters functionality

- **User Experience**
  - Currency formatting for all payment displays
  - Date/time formatting for scheduled dates
  - Error handling and user feedback
  - Loading states and empty states

## Validation Rules

### Payment Amount Validation

- Must be a positive number (≥ 0)
- Maximum value: $999,999.99
- Must have at most 2 decimal places
- Can be null/undefined (no payment set)

### Security & Authorization

- All endpoints require authentication
- Admin-only access to payment management
- User attribution for all payment changes
- Audit trail preservation

## Database Schema Changes

### Task Collection

```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields
  paymentAmount: {
    type: Number,
    min: [0, "Payment amount must be positive"],
    max: [999999.99, "Payment amount cannot exceed $999,999.99"],
    validate: {
      validator: function (v) {
        if (v === null || v === undefined) return true;
        return Number.isFinite(v) && v >= 0 && Math.round(v * 100) === v * 100;
      },
      message: "Payment amount must be a valid monetary value with up to 2 decimal places"
    }
  }
}
```

### TaskPaymentHistory Collection

```javascript
{
  taskId: String, // ObjectId reference
  orderId: String, // ObjectId reference
  previousAmount: Number, // nullable
  newAmount: Number, // nullable
  changedBy: String, // ObjectId reference
  changedByName: String,
  reason: String, // optional
  createdAt: Date // auto-generated
}
```

   - Test null/undefined values

2. **Payment History**

   - Verify all changes are logged
   - Test payment clearing
   - Verify audit trail integrity

3. **Reporting**

   - Test all report types
   - Verify filtering functionality
   - Test edge cases (no data, large datasets)

4. **User Interface**

   - Verify error handling
   - Test modal interactions

### API Testing

- Payment amount CRUD operations
- Report generation with various filters
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Authentication and authorization

## Performance Considerations

- Compound indexes for common filter combinations
- Aggregation pipeline optimization for reports

### Frontend Optimization

- Pagination for large task lists (limit 1000 tasks)
- Debounced filter updates
- Efficient state management

## Security Measures

### Data Protection

- Input validation on both client and server
- SQL injection prevention through Mongoose
- XSS protection through input sanitization

### Access Control

- Session-based authentication
- Audit logging for all payment changes

## Conclusion

The Task Payment Amount Management feature has been successfully implemented with comprehensive CRUD operations, robust validation, audit logging, and an intuitive admin interface. The system provides administrators with the tools needed to effectively manage contractor compensation while maintaining data integrity and security.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow

1. **Visitor sees promo modal** → `trackPromoModalDisplayed()`
2. **Visitor interacts with modal** → Event-specific tracking functions
3. **Data stored in MongoDB** → Visitor interaction collection
4. **Analytics processing** → Real-time calculation of metrics
5. **Dashboard display** → Visual representation of insights

### Performance Considerations

- **Asynchronous Tracking**: Non-blocking visitor experience
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if tracking fails
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized database indexes for analytics
- **Real-time Updates**: Live dashboard updates as data comes in

### Privacy & Compliance

- **Anonymous Tracking**: No personally identifiable information stored
- **Visitor ID Based**: Uses generated visitor IDs, not personal data
- **Opt-out Friendly**: Tracking can be disabled without breaking functionality
- **Data Retention**: Follows standard visitor analytics retention policies

## Usage Examples

### Tracking a Promo Display

```typescript
await trackPromoModalDisplayed({
  promoName: "Christmas Special 2024",
  promoType: "holiday",
  promoTitle: "25% Off Holiday Rentals",
  displayDelay: 5,
  persistenceDays: 1,
  currentPage: "/products/bounce-houses",
});
```

### Tracking a Conversion

```typescript
await trackPromoModalConversion({
  promoName: "Christmas Special 2024",
  promoType: "holiday",
  conversionType: "coupon_form",
  viewDuration: 12.5,
  conversionValue: 75,
});
```

## Analytics Queries

### Top Performing Promos

// Get promos sorted by conversion rate
const topPromos = visitors
  .flatMap((v) => v.interactions)
  .filter((i) => i.type === "promo_modal_displayed")
  .reduce((acc, interaction) => {
    // Group by promo name and calculate metrics
  });
```

### Device Performance Analysis

```javascript
// Compare conversion rates by device type
const deviceMetrics = visitors.reduce((acc, visitor) => {
  const promoInteractions = visitor.interactions.filter((i) =>
    i.type.includes("promo_modal"),
  );
  // Calculate device-specific conversion rates
});
```

Technical Considerations
Based on your existing architecture, you'll need:

New MongoDB Schemas:

Task model with references to Order and User
Employee model (extending User with employee-specific fields)
TaskTemplate model for bulk creation

New API Endpoints:

/api/v1/tasks - CRUD operations for tasks
/api/v1/orders/:id/tasks - Task management within orders
/api/v1/employees/:id/tasks - Employee-specific task views
/api/v1/task-templates - Template management

Frontend Components:

TaskManager component for order detail view
EmployeeDashboard for task assignments
TaskCalendar integration
Mobile-optimized task views

Authentication Updates:

Employee role in RBAC system
Task-specific permissions
API middleware for employee access
